##Front-End

*Utilized bootstrap with parallax to present main introduction page
*Determined layout placement of APIs when calls returned
*Created a search bar that included all classes and ID's necessary for back-end
*Designed website with media queries so that it can be functional with all screen sizes (from phones to projectors)


#Back-End

*Determined the best APIs that would be used to bring content to the webpage.
*Timed the API calls so that all content would display in an ordered fashion, as opposed to all at once.
*Ensured that input form can still load new content after the initial search, should the user decide to search another movie.
*Accounted for edge cases, such as a movie with more than one match
