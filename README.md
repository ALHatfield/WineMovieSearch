# WineMovieSearch

Experience movies like nothing else...

A simple search engine set up to supply movie information and cheap entertainment while you wait for your requested movie to show up. It uses the following APIs to deliver content to you:

<h2 align="center">Application Program Interfaces</h2>

<div class="row">

</div>

<h2>Front-End</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Utilized bootstrap with parallax to present main introduction page</li>
  <li>Determined layout placement of APIs when calls returned</li>
  <li>Created a search bar that included all classes and ID's necessary for back-end</li>
  <li>Designed website with media queries so that it can be functional with all screen sizes (from phones to projectors)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Back-End</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Determined the best APIs that would be used to bring content to the webpage</li>
  <li>Timed the API calls so that all content would display in an ordered fashion, as opposed to all at once.</li>
  <li>Ensured that input form can still load new content after the initial search, should the user decide to search another movie</li>
  <li>Accounted for edge cases, such as a movie with more than one match</li>
</ul>
